## INSTACART ANALYSIS REPORT

A quick exploration on Instacart grocery store data to derive insights and help the owners make good decision.
In this report, 5 key datapoints we will look at 
1. Market Basket Analysis: To identify products that are frequently purchased together.
Bag of Organic bananas and Organic hass avocado are the most product pairs being purchased together

2. Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on their purchase history and other factors.
I segmented the customers based on purchase history into Consistent, Inconsistent and Regular Buyers or Customers.
On segmentation based on purchase history,83.3% of customers purchases make up the Consistent customers which is the highest of the three segments based on customer purchase.
Going further, i segmented the customers based on order. We have the High customer (Customers whose total orders is equal to 80 and above), Medium customers (Customers whose total orders is equal to 30 and above, but less than 80) and Low customers (Customers whose total orders is less than 30). Amongst the three types of customers based on total orders, the low customer segment tops the chart of customer segmentation by total order.

3. Seasonal trend analysis: To identify seasonal trends in sales and customer behavior.
It was discovered that customers make most of their purchases on Sunday and Monday, with Thursday and Wednesday being the least respectively. This can be related to daily lives as people prefer to make their shopping during the weekends than weekdays.

4. Customer Churn prediction: Identify customers who are at the risk of churning
A total of 63,100 customers are at the risk of churning.

5. Departmental and Aisle sales: Identify sales that thrive the most in department and aisle.
Fresh fruits have the highest number of sales which is over 1m.
The produce department makes more sales than other departments in the grocery store.

With these analysis, we can further enhance market strategies,improve inventory management, understand our customers preference and choice thus, helping in promo activities. Have a knowledge of our customer spending behavior and their purchase frequent rate and help target marketing efforts.
We also have an idea of when we have most of our orders, getting staffs ready to attend to orders as they come in multitude with respect to days of the week. We also get to know our customers that have been inactive in the last 30 days, and further engage them.
