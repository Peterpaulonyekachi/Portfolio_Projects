## Coffee Sales Report

Having sold for the first 6 months of the calendar year, we dive into the sales data for a coffee store to derive insights and help in good decision making thus affecting sales positively.

1. ### Revenue Sales:
During the initial six months of the calendar year, they achieved a total revenue of $504,343, with the majority of sales occurring in June ($119,571). Apart from Saturday, which experienced a significant decline in sales, the remaining days of the week exhibit comparable sales, with differences of less than 3%. Across the three store locations, there appears to be a 1% to 3% variance in revenue. The Coffee and Tea product category contributes to 50% of the total revenue, with the coffee category leading in terms of sales. Hell's Kitchen maintains a relatively consistent percentage of the overall revenue.

2. ### Time of Day:
The peak sales and revenue occur between 8:00 am and 10:00 am, making it the busiest period. Specifically, 10:00 am stands out with the highest number of transactions, reaching 18,545, and a corresponding quantity sold of 27,313. During this hour, a substantial total revenue of $64,858 was generated, marking the pinnacle of sales across all three store locations. This can be attributed to the trend of workers, particularly the working class, making breakfast purchases during the 8:00 am to 10:00 am timeframe. The heightened sales during these hours can be attributed to this behavior, explaining the overall increase in sales throughout this time span.

3. ### Product Analysis:
The coffee product emerges as the most widely purchased item, totaling approximately 58,416 purchases. Notably, there is a substantial surge in its sales, correlating with the time of dayâ€”commencing at 6 am, reaching its zenith at 10 am, followed by a sharp decline at 11 am. Subsequently, purchases taper off gradually until the end of the workday. Coffee, recognized for its ability to keep individuals alert, particularly within the working class, is predominantly bought in the early morning hours. Its peak occurs during mid-morning, driven by heightened demand from office workers seeking an energy boost during the early part of their day.

4. ### Selling product:
The most frequently bought item is the Brewed Chai tea, contributing significantly to a total revenue of $50,466. Notably, there is a relative variance in purchases between 8 am and 10 am, generating revenues of $6,037 and $6,076, respectively. It is worth highlighting that the Astoria store location leads in the sales of the Brewed Chai tea product.
