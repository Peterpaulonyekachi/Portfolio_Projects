## NTBCC REPORT


In this real-time data analysis project, we delved into the realm of tuberculosis (TB) diseases, examining their prevalence across diverse demographics, states, and geopolitical zones. Furthermore, we scrutinized the real-time utilization of channels for disease testing and the dissemination of service-related information.

1. ### Calls overview
In our analysis, we explored the comprehensive metrics related to incoming calls, encompassing the total number of calls received, the subset of callers who chose to interact with call center agents directly, and those who opted for self-service options.

2. ### Gender Distribution
In our gender distribution analysis, we delve into the dataset based on gender, geopolitical zone, and state, dissecting these distributions to understand gender-specific trends. Our findings reveal a higher tuberculosis rate among males in relation to calls and positive test results.

3. ### Case Categories
Within our case categorizations, we thoroughly examine the reasons for calls, spanning from inquiries for information and services to non-tuberculosis-related calls, complaints, and other cases. Notably, inquiries for information emerge as the predominant category, constituting approximately 34.89% of all cases.

4. ### Language selection
In our language segmentation analysis, we examine the diverse languages spoken by callers when communicating with call center agents, detailing their reasons for calling. The languages include Hausa, English, Pidgin, Yoruba, and Igbo, with Hausa being the most prevalent. Additionally, we provide follow-up statistics to illustrate the number of presumptive cases reached, those who underwent testing, and their respective results, categorized by gender, geopolitical zone, and the health facilities utilized for testing.
