## Title
### Hospital Management System: Streamlining Healthcare Operations

## Description
The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to optimize and manage various hospital operations. It includes functionalities for patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, and admissions tracking.

The project utilizes MySQL for database management, Python for data handling, and Power BI for advanced data visualization and reporting. By integrating these technologies, the system provides healthcare administrators with insights into hospital trends, patient demographics, revenue streams, and resource allocation.

This project aims to enhance efficiency, improve patient care, and support data-driven decision-making within healthcare facilities.

### These queries demonstrates how to interact with the Database
```sql 

```
### Python Code 
To validate the efficiency and functionality of the database design, I populated the tables with realistic sample data. This allowed me to thoroughly test the relationships between the tables and ensure the database performed as expected under simulated conditions.

See below the python code i used in achieving this

The code successfully populated the hospital_management_system database with data, allowing me to perform in-depth analysis on the system. The following SQL queries demonstrate additional insights gained from the hospital management system analysis.

```sql

After conducting analysis on the data in MySQL, I decided to visualize the insights using Power BI. This enables stakeholders to monitor key trends and activities within the hospital, providing valuable support for informed decision-making. The visualizations are designed to assist the hospital management in making strategic decisions that will drive the hospital's growth.


### Power BI Report

This report provides key insights into various aspects of hospital operations, including patient demographics, doctor performance, admission trends, appointment scheduling, and financial metrics. These findings, visualized in the linked Power BI dashboard, highlight critical indicators that can guide decision-making and strategic planning within the hospital.

#### Key Insights:

Total Patients: 1,000

Gender Breakdown: 502 male, 498 female

Insurance Distribution: Insurer B had the highest number of patients (377), while Insurer D had the lowest (97)

Age Distribution: The 81+ age group was the largest (146 patients), and the 1‚Äì20 age group was the smallest (38 patients)

Geographic Distribution: Montana had the highest patient count (26 patients)

Revenue by Gender: Male patients contributed $2,625,915 in revenue

#### Doctor Performance:

Top Specialties: Neurology had the most appointments, totaling 268 (26.8% of all appointments)

Consultation Time: Dr. Judith Garcia (Pediatrics) had the highest consultation time (103.08 minutes)
Highest Number of Appointments: Dr. Matthew Day recorded 30 appointments

#### Admission Trends:

Top Reasons for Admission: Quadriplegia and Jaundice had the longest hospital stays (36 days)

Admission Peaks: Highest single-day admissions occurred on Sunday, Sep 22, 2024

Room Type Utilization: Semi-private rooms had 282 admissions, with heart attacks being the most common reason (34 admissions)
Appointment Scheduling and Financial Metrics:

#### Monthly Trends:
October had more appointments than November

Status: Cancellations outnumbered scheduled and completed appointments, totaling 356

Day-wise Trends: Friday was the busiest day, with 186 appointments

Departmental Revenue: The Emergency Department led with $1,180,281 in revenue

Revenue by Gender: Female patients contributed $548,936, and male patients $631,345

#### Room Utilization and Scheduling:

Semi-private Room Trends: Patients spent 6,186 days in semi-private rooms, with Wednesday recording the highest occupancy (50 days)

This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of hospital operations, emphasizing key patient demographics, high-performing doctors, admission trends, and financial performance by department and insurance type. By monitoring these metrics, the hospital can enhance resource allocation, improve appointment scheduling, and strengthen financial planning.

#### Recommendations for Improvement:

Optimize Staffing in High-Demand Specialties: Reduce wait times and improve doctor utilization.

Outreach and Insurance-Based Patient Acquisition: Expand the insurance coverage mix to increase patient inflow.

Expand Semi-Private Room Facilities: Increase bed availability and reduce wait times.
Improve Financial Recovery in Emergency 

Department: Enhance revenue collection rates and improve cash flow.

Enhanced Patient Scheduling: Reduce missed appointments and minimize revenue loss.
Admission Adjustments for High-Frequency 

Conditions: Allocate resources efficiently and reduce re-admissions.

Enhance Age-Specific Care Services: Improve outcomes for elderly patients and expand services.
